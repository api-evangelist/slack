      The Slack Admin API is a set of privileged endpointsprimarily under
      admin.* with related SCIM and Audit Logs APIsthat lets Enterprise Grid
      owners and admins automate organizationwide management and governance. It
      covers user lifecycle (provision, suspend, assign roles), workspace and
      channel administration across workspaces (create, move, archive channels;
      manage membership and settings), app governance (approve/deny or
      allowlist/ban apps and install them to workspaces), invite request
      handling, and security/compliance controls such as information barriers,
      session and authentication policies, and orglevel analytics exports.
      These APIs require elevated admin scopes and are commonly used to power
      automated onboarding/offboarding, centralized channel and app controls,
      and integrations with identity, ITSM, and compliance systems.

      Im not aware of an official Slack product literally called Tests API.
      Typically, when people say Slack Tests API, they mean using Slacks
      existing APIs and SDK tooling to automate tests for Slack apps. In
      practice, developers call Slacks Web API to set up test data (channels,
      users, messages), craft Events API and interactive payloads to exercise
      handlers, and use SDK-provided mocks to assert responses and error
      handling in CI. This approach lets teams verify permissions, rate-limit
      behavior, and message/Block Kit rendering, so bots, workflows, and
      functions behave correctly before deployment. If you meant a specific
      third-party tool or a particular Slack feature by that name, let me know
      and I can tailor the description.

      The Slack Apps API is a set of platform APIs and tools that let developers
      build apps to extend Slack and automate work. With it, you can read and
      write data via the Web API (messages, channels, files, reactions), receive
      real-time events using the Events API or Socket Mode, and create
      interactive experiences with Block Kit, modals, buttons, shortcuts, and
      slash commands. Apps can post messages, run workflows, add custom steps to
      Workflow Builder, manage conversations, and act as bot users. Installation
      uses OAuth 2.0 with granular permission scopes and token types, and
      enterprise features are supported through admin APIs. Together, these
      capabilities connect external systems to Slack, trigger actions from
      conversations, and orchestrate end-to-end processes without leaving the
      chat.

      Slacks Auth API covers the authentication and authorization pieces that
      let apps securely identify users and workspaces and manage access. It
      includes OAuth 2.0 endpoints used during app installation to request
      scopes and exchange authorization codes for tokens (with optional token
      rotation), plus OpenID Connect for Sign in with Slack so you can
      authenticate users and retrieve standard identity claims. Within the Web
      API, methods like auth.test let you verify a token and learn which user
      and workspace it belongs to, auth.revoke allows you to invalidate tokens,
      and auth.teams.list helps enumerate the workspaces a user can use with
      your app (useful for multi-workspace and Enterprise Grid scenarios).
      Together, these capabilities ensure your app knows who is calling, what
      its allowed to do, and where, before invoking other Slack APIs.

      Slacks bot APIs let you build apps that live in Slack and automate work
      by listening for events and taking actions in conversations. Using the Web
      API, your bot can post and schedule messages, reply in threads, manage
      channels, look up users, and access files or reactions; the Events API
      delivers message, reaction, and workflow events to your server so you can
      respond in real time. Bots can power slash commands, message shortcuts,
      and interactive UI elements (buttons, menus, modals built with Block Kit),
      and they can open modals or update messages dynamically. Installation and
      access are controlled via OAuth 2.0 scopes, with bot tokens used to
      authenticate API calls; you can receive events over HTTPS or via Socket
      Mode if you dont host a public endpoint. Together, these capabilities let
      you create assistants that answer questions, route approvals, connect
      external services, and streamline team processes directly inside Slack.

      The Slack Conversations API is the unified Web API for working with all
      types of Slack conversationspublic and private channels, direct messages,
      and multi-person DMs. It lets apps discover and inspect conversations,
      list members, and read message history and threads, as well as create,
      join, invite, leave, and archive channels where permissions allow. By
      consolidating the legacy channels.*, groups.*, im.*, and mpim.* endpoints
      into conversations.*, it provides consistent IDs and behavior across
      conversation types. It supports cursor-based pagination, filtering by
      conversation type, and granular OAuth scopes to ensure apps only access
      authorized data. Developers use it to find the right place to post, fetch
      context for workflows, manage membership, and build features that traverse

      with a short-lived trigger_id, then present fields like text inputs,
      textareas, and select menus (including dynamic, server-powered options).
      When users submit or cancel, Slack sends a dialog_submission or
      dialog_cancellation payload to the app, which can validate inputs and send
      dialog_errors for inline feedback before completing the workflow. Dialogs
      are ephemeral to the user and well-suited for tasks like creating tickets,
      requesting PTO, or gathering parameters. Note: Slack now recommends using
      Block Kit modals via the Views API, which supersede legacy dialogs.

      current DND state and scheduled quiet hours, retrieve team-wide DND
      summaries (where permitted), start or extend a snooze for a specified
      duration, and end snooze or active DND. Key methods include dnd.info,
      dnd.teamInfo, dnd.setSnooze, dnd.endSnooze, and dnd.endDnd. Responses
      provide whether DND is enabled and timestamps for when it starts and ends,
      enabling apps to defer messages, schedule work, or adjust notification
      behavior. The API is designed to respect user preferences and workspace
      policies; apps should handle rate limits and note that they can set
      temporary snoozes but cannot programmatically change a users full DND
      schedule.

      alias:other_name) and a cache timestamp to help clients sync efficiently.
      Apps can also subscribe to the emoji_changed event to stay up to date when
      emoji are added, renamed, or removed. On Enterprise Grid, org admins get
      additional admin.emoji.* methods to programmatically add, rename, alias,
      or remove custom emoji with appropriate admin scopes. The API focuses on
      metadata and management of custom emoji (not standard Unicode emoji) and

      The Slack OAuth API implements the OAuth 2.0 flow that lets developers
      securely install Slack apps to workspaces and obtain access tokens with
      specific, granular scopes. An app redirects a user to Slack for consent;
      after approval, Slack returns an authorization code that the app exchanges
      for tokens (typically a bot token, and optionally a user token) to call
      the Web API within the granted permissions. The OAuth system manages
      scopes, workspace and enterprise installations, admin approvals,
      reauthorization when scopes change, token rotation with refresh tokens,
      and revocation when apps are uninstalled or access is removed. For user
      sign-in, Slack also offers an OpenID Connectbased flow. In short, it
      provides consent-driven installation, permissioning, and token lifecycle
      management for Slack apps.

      things for quick reference. Note that Slack has moved toward Saved items
      and other mechanisms in the client, and the stars.* methods have been
      deprecated, so availability and support may be limited.

      Slacks Team API is the part of the Slack Web API that lets apps read
      workspace-level (team) information and, for admins, certain audit and
      billing data. With it, apps can fetch basic workspace identity and
      metadata (name, domain, icon, enterprise association), discover team
      preferences and custom profile fields, and, where permitted, retrieve
      billable info plus access and integration logs for auditing and compliance
      use cases. This helps apps tailor behavior to a workspaces settings,
      build admin dashboards, or automate governance. Access is gated by OAuth
      scopes (for example, team:read and various admin scopes), and many methods
      are limited to workspace or org admins; it doesnt handle messages or
      individual user data beyond whats needed to describe the workspace.

      Slacks User Groups API lets apps programmatically create and manage user
      groups (mentionable aliases like @eng or @oncall) in a workspace. It
      supports creating, renaming, and updating groups and their handles and
      descriptions; setting default channels; enabling or disabling groups;
      listing groups; and adding or removing members in bulk. User groups make
      it easy to notify the right people with a single mention and to auto-add
      members to specific channels via default channel settings. Teams use the
      API to automate org changes, sync groups from an identity provider, manage
      on-call rotations, and streamline onboarding/offboarding. Its exposed via
      usergroups.* and usergroups.users.* Web API methods and typically requires
      the usergroups:read and usergroups:write scopes, with appropriate admin
      permissions and a paid Slack plan.

      Slacks Users API is a set of Web API methods that let your app discover
      and work with people in a Slack workspace. It can list members, fetch
      details for a specific user, look up users by email, and retrieve profile
      data such as names, photos, status, time zones, and custom fields. Where
      permitted, it can also read presence and update a users profile or photo
      with the proper user-level authorization. Developers use it to map real
      identities to Slack user IDs, personalize experiences, resolve mentions
      and DMs, and distinguish between human, bot, and app users. Access to
      specific data and actions depends on scopes (for example, users:read,
      users:read.email, users.profile:read/write), and certain capabilities like
      presence have additional restrictions. For provisioning and enterprise
      directory management, Slacks SCIM API is used instead.

      The Slack Views API lets your app build and control Block Kit interfaces
      inside Slackprimarily modals and the App Home tab. With methods like
      views.open, views.update, and views.push, your app can launch multi-step
      modal flows in response to interactive triggers (slash commands,
      shortcuts, or message actions), update them in place, or push new steps
      onto the stack. Using views.publish, you can render a personalized,
      dynamic Home tab for each user. Submissions and closes generate
      interactivity payloads (view_submission and view_closed) that let you
      validate inputs, return per-field errors, and persist state; you can also
      pass callback_id and private_metadata to track context. Concurrency is
      handled via a view hash to avoid overwriting stale content. In short, the
      Views API provides the lifecycle and plumbing for rich, interactive app
      experiences directly in Slack.

      Slacks Workflows API lets you automate work inside Slack by defining
      workflowsordered steps or functionsthat run in response to triggers like
      shortcuts, messages, schedules, link clicks, or webhooks. Developers can
      build Slacknative steps, collect inputs with forms, post messages, route
      approvals, and call external services, then programmatically create and
      manage triggers and runs. On Slacks latest platform, you compose
      workflows from reusable functions, persist data in datastores, and run
      code on Slacks infrastructure; on classic Workflow Builder, you can add
      custom steps and report completion or failure via API. The result is
      secure, auditable, Slackintegrated automation for tasks such as
      onboarding, incident response, requests, and notifications without
      standing up a separate backend.
